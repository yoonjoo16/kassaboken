## Description
It is a cash book program for me and my parter. We had used Google Sheet to record all expenses we spent, and to calculate debt to each other. 
However, my partner had problem using functions in Google Sheet, and therefore I started making an easy cash book program for him. 

## What are used?
* JSP
* MySQL
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Bootstrap for CSS

## Process
* Already in March 2020, I made a program using javaFX. The program works parsing the Google sheet files and it loads/saves information there.
* Because my partner prefered a web application, I started to plan for it. To make it possible, I took a summer course in 2020, and learned basic of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* To use a database, I learned how to use MySQL watching Youtube tutorials.
* I searched how to use SQL in HTML, and found JSP. I learned JSP watching Youtube tutorials.
* During Dec 19-22, I watched a Youtube playlist and learned how to make JSP-page, use data from database, get parameter from a form and use it.
* After that, I started my project on 23 Dec and finished 31 Dec. And we started to use it 2021!
